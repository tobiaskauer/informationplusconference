## Interdisciplinary practices in information design and visualization

Information+ is a biennial conference that brings together researchers,
educators, and practitioners in **information design and data
visualization** to explore shared questions and challenges in these
rapidly changing fields. We aim to provoke rich, interdisciplinary
discourse on how information representation engages within social,
political and environmental contexts.

Information+ 2025 will be held in-person in Boston, USA, between
November 14â€“16, hosted by [Northeastern University's College of Arts,
Media, and Design (CAMD)](https://camd.northeastern.edu/) and [MIT's
School of Architecture and Planning](https://sap.mit.edu/overview)
through the [Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism
(LCAU)](https://lcau.mit.edu/) and [Morningside Academy of Design
(MAD)](https://design.mit.edu/). CAMD, LCAU, and MAD actively promote
interdisciplinary approaches to teaching and research in information
design, data visualization, and related fields.
