[Information+,](https://informationplusconference.com/2025/) an
interdisciplinary conference for information design and data
visualization, invites participatory workshop proposals from all
relevant areas of professional practice, research, and pedagogy.

[Submit here](https://submissions.infoplus.team){.button .is-primary}

[Socials and Contacts](https://linktr.ee/informationplusconference){.button .is-primary}

We welcome submissions on broad topics that connect to the overall
conference theme of ENERGY, broadly defined to include social, physical,
natural, logistical, and other related aspects. This might include:
information design, critical visualization, designing with data, data
visualization, physicalization, data aesthetics, data criticality, data
or visual journalism, industrial practice analysis around data,
visualization education, cultural analytics, data studies, digital
civics, digital humanities, environmental action, health information,
historical collections, science communication, and social advocacy.

Workshops can be fun, provoke reflection, educate participants on
existing or emerging topics, create a community of practice, or
stimulate discussion by bringing complementary hands-on activities to
the main track. We are looking for a broad scope of workshops that
relate to data, from tutorials that integrate new technologies into
creative practice, to constructing data sculptures and interventions in
the streets of Boston, to counterdata production strategies on contested
public topics, or beyond. We aim to select workshops that support
interaction rather than passive listening. Workshops will have a
prominent role in the conference. We are open to experimental and
unconventional formats, but we expect mature workshops that have already
been piloted.

Workshops will run the day before the main conference track. Workshops
should be planned for 3 hours with attendance between 20 to 60 people,
and we will curate them into morning or afternoon slots offering options
in parallel for participants to pick between. Exceptions will be
considered based on their merits.

Proposals should contain the following elements: a description of the
goal, the process and the expected outcome of the workshop, as well as
all constraints to run it (e.g. material, time attendance, participant
experience etc.) and how this workshop might be beneficial for the
attendees. Submission should be made online here:
<https://submissions.infoplus.team/>.

The workshops will be selected through a curatorial process including an
international jury of academics and professionals in the domains design,
art and computer science. The criteria for selection will include
assessments of the feasibility, creativity, and interactivity in order
to create a balanced program with regards to content and
representation.Â
