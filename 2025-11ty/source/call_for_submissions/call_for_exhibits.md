*Northeastern University + Massachusetts Institute of Technology*\
**MIT Media Lab East Lobby, November 11/14 to 11/16, 2025**

The Information+ 2025 Conference invites artists, designers,
researchers, and practitioners to submit proposals for an exhibition
exploring the theme of energy transition and its intersection with
information technologies. Submissions may address topics such as
sustainability, climate justice, energy inclusion, digital tools for
energy, and visualizations of energy flows and data. The exhibition aims
to inspire and advance conversations around innovative approaches to
energy generation, consumption, distribution, policy, and the digital
systems shaping a more sustainable future.

We welcome diverse approaches, from visualizations of energy flows and
data, to projects addressing energy equity and inclusion, to artistic
and conceptual interpretations of energy in digital tools and beyond.

## **Exhibition Theme**

The exhibition will explore intersections between energy and information
technologies, engaging with questions about sustainability, climate
justice, energy inclusion, digital tools for energy, and visualizations
of energy flows and data. We are looking for multiple, diverse
definitions of energy.

Energy is often discussed in the contexts of sustainability, climate
justice, and technological systems, but how do you define energy? How
does it feature in your work? What does energy mean to you? We welcome
diverse approaches, from visualizations of energy flows and data to
creative interpretations of energy's role in shaping our shared future.

To help you conceptualize and prepare your proposal, here are several
diverse definitions of energy and illustrative exhibition examples.

#### Example Definitions of Energy

1.  **Physical Science**: Energy is the capacity to do work, existing in
    various forms such as kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical,
    electrical, and nuclear.
2.  **Environmental Science**: Energy refers to natural resources (e.g.,
    solar, wind, fossil fuels) harnessed for human use.
3.  **Sociocultural Context**: Energy can symbolize vitality, effort, or
    momentum within a community, project, or system.
4.  **Information Technology**: Energy may describe computational power,
    data processing efficiency, or the energy consumption of digital
    systems.
5.  **Artistic/Metaphorical**: Energy might represent movement,
    transformation, or emotional resonance in creative expressions.

#### Exhibition Examples

1.  **Renewable Energy Installations**: exhibits that showcase solar
    panel usage or wind turbine energy conversion in real-time.
2.  **Data-Driven Art**: A digital installation visualizing global CO₂
    emissions or energy inequities across regions.
3.  **Policy and Access**: Projects addressing energy inclusion, such as
    mapping underserved communities\' access to sustainable energy
    sources.
4.  **Digital Energy Tools**: Simulations or applications that model
    future energy scenarios based on current consumption and renewable
    adoption rates.
5.  **Cultural Practices**: Artistic representations of energy as a
    cultural force, such as indigenous approaches to land and energy
    stewardship.

## **Funding and Support**

The Information+ 2025 Exhibition offers funding to support a range of
innovative and impactful projects, tailored to different formats and
scales:

#### *1. Physical Installation*

- **Funding Amount:** One project up to \$3,000
- This installation can be proposed either in the Media Lab Building,
  Killian Court in MIT, Court East to Walker Memorial at MIT, or an open
  space at Northeastern University.
- Description:
  - Designed for immersive, physical exhibits that require significant
    material, labor, or technical resources.
  - Must involve interdisciplinary collaboration between multiple
    individuals or groups.
  - Ideal for projects that transform the space and engage audiences
    through physical interaction.
- **Space Dimensions:** 12′ × 12′ × 10′ height.

#### *2. Digital Exhibition*

- **Funding Amount:** Up to \$500 each (five projects)
- Description:
  - Focused on digital or screen-based works utilizing devices provided
    by MIT and Northeastern.
  - Suitable for dynamic visualizations, audio-visual presentations, or
    interactive experiences.
- **Space Dimensions:** 5′ × 5′ × 6′ height.

#### *3. Two-Dimensional Works*

- **Funding Amount:** Printing costs for up to 10 A1 works
- Description:
  - Platform for visually compelling visualizations, drawings, collages,
    etc.
  - Posters should engage viewers through clarity, creativity, and
    thought-provoking content.

Physical Installation and Digital exhibition project teams will
participate in a panel at the Information+ Conference during the
exhibition\'s opening. All projects will receive installation support
and guidance from the exhibition team.
