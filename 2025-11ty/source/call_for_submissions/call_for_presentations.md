[Information+ 2025](https://informationplusconference.com/2025/) invites
submissions for presentations that explore critical insights,
provocations, theories, practices, and experiences in information
design, data visualization, and their applications. We welcome
contributions from design practitioners, artists, academics, and
professionals across the humanities, sciences, and other
interdisciplinary fields.

At a time when the need for effective information design and insightful
data visualization has never been more urgent, Information+ 2025 will
gather scholars, practitioners, and educators to critically discuss the
role these disciplines play amidst rising democratic erosion and
polarization. Our goal is to collectively foster momentum for protecting
rights, supporting inclusive political organizing, and envisioning
sustainable futures in harmony with our planet.

We particularly seek presentations that engage our community in timely,
thought-provoking, interdisciplinary dialogues on the design,
evaluation, and societal implications of information design and data
visualization. Diverse perspectives, innovative topics, and
contributions from underrepresented voices are especially encouraged.
Presentations may include provocations, reflections, challenges,
experiments, and works-in-progress, aiming to motivate, inspire, and
drive meaningful cross-disciplinary exchanges. See examples of topics
and domains at the end of this call.

## Presentation Format

Accepted submissions will be presented in person at the conference in a
single-track format, organized into sessions. Presentations should be 10
minutes, followed by open discussions. You may request additional
presentation time on the submission form, but this will depend on
program availability and is not guaranteed.

Submissions will undergo a single-blind peer review by our international
Program Committee. The final program selection will be made by our
Program Chairs based on these reviews. Information+ 2023 in Edinburgh
had 137 submissions, with 32 accepted presentations.
