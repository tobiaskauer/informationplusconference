Amazonian Calendars: Indigenous Data Visualizations centers Indigenous ways of knowing within the field of data visualization through a collaboration between MIT and Quechua communities in the so-called Peruvian Amazon. Led by Catherine D’Ignazio and Claudia Tomateo, a Quechua-Chanka PhD student, the project unfolds as a continuation of long-standing relationships with PRATEC and Waman Wasi, nonprofits that have facilitated the creation of community calendars for more than 35 years.

Indigenous visualizations are a significant part of the past and present of data visualization, though they have been largely overlooked by Western historians and practitioners. In the Amazon, Quechua community members create large-scale calendars that visualize ancestral activities, regenerate biocultural diversity, and communicate knowledge. Each calendar uniquely represents Quechua-Amazonian worldviews through artistic depictions of humans, animals, water, and forests that reflect the community’s context and aspirations. These cosmo-visualizations embody intergenerational expressions of worldmaking.
Western artists and data visualization practitioners stand to learn a great deal from Indigenous visualizers. Through collaborating with PRATEC and Waman Wasi, the project emphasizes the importance of orality as a foundation for artistic expression and for the transmission of knowledge. Using Indigenous methodologies grounded in the principles of respect, reciprocity, relevance, and responsibility, the exhibition is co-designed with Quechua artists, elders, youth, and community leaders. The process involves ongoing dialogue and collaboration across the three communities of Yaku Shutuna Rumi Alto Huaja, Simbakiwi Yaku Santa Elena, and Maray, where the co-design workshops and film recordings took place.

Each community’s organizational structure forms an integral part of the project. Within PRATEC and Waman Wasis’s network, every community includes an Apu (community leader), Gestor Comunitario (youth leadership), Warmikuna Tarpudoras(intergenerational group of women leading biodiversity initiatives), Presidenta de las Warmikunas, Grupo de Abuelos(grandfathers dedicated to forest care and medicine), and Presidente de Abuelos. The Indigenous visualizers, who are part of the Gestores Comunitarios, facilitate the making of the communal calendar and serve as key collaborators and points of contact throughout the exhibition process.

This exhibition emerges from relationships that have been cultivated over time, rather than as a single event. It represents an ongoing commitment to hold space for Indigenous art and knowledge resurgence within academic and artistic institutions. For the first time at MIT, an exhibition of this scale presents community-created visualizations from the Amazon narrated and explained by community members themselves.

Amazonian Calendars opens within the context of the Information+ 2025 Conference at MIT, a multidisciplinary event on information design co-hosted by the Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism. The exhibition invites students, scholars, and visitors to engage with Indigenous approaches to data, design, and worldmaking, catalyzing conversations about what visualization can be when grounded in relationality and reciprocity.
The exhibition is made possible with the generous support of the MIT Center for Art, Science & Technology (CAST), the Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism (LCAU), and the PKG Center for Public Service.
