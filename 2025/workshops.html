  <h1>Information+ 2025 Call for Workshops</h1>
  <p><a href="https://informationplusconference.com/2025/">Information+,</a> an interdisciplinary conference for information design and data visualization, invites participatory workshop proposals from all relevant areas of professional practice, research, and pedagogy.</p>
  <br/>
  <p><a class="btn" href="https://submissions.infoplus.team">Submit here</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We welcome submissions on broad topics that connect to the overall conference theme of ENERGY, broadly defined to include social, physical, natural, logistical, and other related aspects. This might include: information design, critical visualization, designing with data, data visualization, physicalization, data aesthetics, data criticality, data or visual journalism, industrial practice analysis around data, visualization education, cultural analytics, data studies, digital civics, digital humanities, environmental action, health information, historical collections, science communication, and social advocacy.</p>
  <p>Workshops can be fun, provoke reflection, educate participants on existing or emerging topics, create a community of practice, or stimulate discussion by bringing complementary hands-on activities to the main track. We are looking for a broad scope of workshops that relate to data, from tutorials that integrate new technologies into creative practice, to constructing data sculptures and interventions in the streets of Boston, to counterdata production strategies on contested public topics, or beyond. We aim to select workshops that support interaction rather than passive listening. Workshops will have a prominent role in the conference. We are open to experimental and unconventional formats, but we expect mature workshops that have already been piloted.</p>
  <p>Workshops will run the day before the main conference track. Workshops should be planned for 3 hours with attendance between 20 to 60 people, and we will curate them into morning or afternoon slots offering options in parallel for participants to pick between. Exceptions will be considered based on their merits.</p>
  <p>Proposals should contain the following elements: a description of the goal, the process and the expected outcome of the workshop, as well as all constraints to run it (e.g. material, time attendance, participant experience etc.) and how this workshop might be beneficial for the attendees. Submission should be made online here: <a href="https://submissions.infoplus.team/">https://submissions.infoplus.team/</a>.</p>
  <p>The workshops will be selected through a curatorial process including an international jury of academics and professionals in the domains design, art and computer science. The criteria for selection will include assessments of the feasibility, creativity, and interactivity in order to create a balanced program with regards to content and representation.&nbsp;</p>
