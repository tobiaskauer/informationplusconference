  <h1>Information+ 2025 Call for Exhibition Proposals</h1>
  <p><em>Northeastern University + Massachusetts Institute of Technology</em><br>
    <strong>MIT Media Lab East Lobby, November 11/14 to 11/16, 2025</strong></p>
  <p>The Information+ 2025 Conference invites artists, designers, researchers, and practitioners to submit proposals for an exhibition exploring the theme of energy transition and its intersection with information technologies. Submissions may address topics such as sustainability, climate justice, energy inclusion, digital tools for energy, and visualizations of energy flows and data. The exhibition aims to inspire and advance conversations around innovative approaches to energy generation, consumption, distribution, policy, and the digital systems shaping a more sustainable future.</p>
  <p>We welcome diverse approaches, from visualizations of energy flows and data, to projects addressing energy equity and inclusion, to artistic and conceptual interpretations of energy in digital tools and beyond.</p>

  <h3><strong>Exhibition Theme</strong></h3>
  <p>The exhibition will explore intersections between energy and information technologies, engaging with questions about sustainability, climate justice, energy inclusion, digital tools for energy, and visualizations of energy flows and data. We are looking for multiple, diverse definitions of energy.</p>
  <p>Energy is often discussed in the contexts of sustainability, climate justice, and technological systems, but how do you define energy? How does it feature in your work? What does energy mean to you? We welcome diverse approaches, from visualizations of energy flows and data to creative interpretations of energy’s role in shaping our shared future.</p>
  <p>To help you conceptualize and prepare your proposal, here are several diverse definitions of energy and illustrative exhibition examples.</p>
  <h4>Example Definitions of Energy</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Physical Science</strong>: Energy is the capacity to do work, existing in various forms such as kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, electrical, and nuclear.</li>
    <li><strong>Environmental Science</strong>: Energy refers to natural resources (e.g., solar, wind, fossil fuels) harnessed for human use.</li>
    <li><strong>Sociocultural Context</strong>: Energy can symbolize vitality, effort, or momentum within a community, project, or system.</li>
    <li><strong>Information Technology</strong>: Energy may describe computational power, data processing efficiency, or the energy consumption of digital systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Artistic/Metaphorical</strong>: Energy might represent movement, transformation, or emotional resonance in creative expressions.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Exhibition Examples</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Renewable Energy Installations</strong>: exhibits that showcase solar panel usage or wind turbine energy conversion in real-time.</li>
    <li><strong>Data-Driven Art</strong>: A digital installation visualizing global CO₂ emissions or energy inequities across regions.</li>
    <li><strong>Policy and Access</strong>: Projects addressing energy inclusion, such as mapping underserved communities' access to sustainable energy sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital Energy Tools</strong>: Simulations or applications that model future energy scenarios based on current consumption and renewable adoption rates.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural Practices</strong>: Artistic representations of energy as a cultural force, such as indigenous approaches to land and energy stewardship.</li>
  </ol>
