  <h1>Information+ Conference&nbsp;2025<br>Boston,&nbsp;MA</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    Information+ is a biennial conference that brings together researchers, 
    educators, and practitioners in data visualization, information design 
    and all design practices. We aim to provoke discussions on how information 
    representation engages within social, political and environmental contexts.        
  </p>
  <h3>Call for Contributions</h3>
  <p>
    The Information+ conference invites submissions for <strong><a href="#presentations">Presentations</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="#workshops">Workshops and Activities</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="#exhibitions">Exhibitions</a></strong>, encouraging
    interdisciplinary contributions that explore the theme of understanding,
    designing, and communicating complex information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Information+ is a biennial conference that brings together researchers
    and practitioners in <strong>information design</strong>
    <strong>and data visualization</strong> to explore shared questions and
    address challenges in these rapidly changing fields. Unlike
    discipline-specific gatherings, Information+ is committed to fostering
    rich, interdisciplinary exchanges and provoke discussions among those
    engaged in the theories, practices, and teaching of analyzing and
    communicating information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Building on the previous editions, Information+ 2025 will be held as an
    in-person event in Cambridge, MA, hosted by <a href="https://camd.northeastern.edu/">
        Northeastern University&rsquo;s
        College of Arts, Media, and Design (CAMD)
    </a> and <a href="https://sap.mit.edu/overview">
        MIT&rsquo;s School of
        Architecture and Planning
    </a> through the <a href="https://lcau.mit.edu/">
        Leventhal Center for Advanced
        Urbanism (LCAU)
    </a> and <a href="https://design.mit.edu/">Morningside Academy of Design (MAD)</a>. CAMD, LCAU, and
    MAD actively promote interdisciplinary approaches to teaching and
    research in information design, data visualization, and related fields.
  </p>
  <p>
