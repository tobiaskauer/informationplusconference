<h1>Information+ 2025 Call for Presentations</h1>
<p><a href="https://informationplusconference.com/2025/">Information+ 2025</a> invites submissions for presentations that explore critical insights, provocations, theories, practices, and experiences in information design, data visualization, and their applications. We welcome contributions from design practitioners, artists, academics, and professionals across the humanities, sciences, and other interdisciplinary fields.</p>
<p>At a time when the need for effective information design and insightful data visualization has never been more urgent, Information+ 2025 will gather scholars, practitioners, and educators to critically discuss the role these disciplines play amidst rising democratic erosion and polarization. Our goal is to collectively foster momentum for protecting rights, supporting inclusive political organizing, and envisioning sustainable futures in harmony with our planet.</p>
<p>We particularly seek presentations that engage our community in timely, thought-provoking, interdisciplinary dialogues on the design, evaluation, and societal implications of information design and data visualization. Diverse perspectives, innovative topics, and contributions from underrepresented voices are especially encouraged. Presentations may include provocations, reflections, challenges, experiments, and works-in-progress, aiming to motivate, inspire, and drive meaningful cross-disciplinary exchanges. See examples of topics and domains at the end of this call.</p>

<h3>Presentation Format</h3>
<p>Accepted submissions will be presented in person at the conference in a single-track format, organized into sessions. Presentations should be 10 minutes, followed by open discussions. You may request additional presentation time on the submission form, but this will depend on program availability and is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Submissions will undergo a single-blind peer review by our international Program Committee. The final program selection will be  made by our Program Chairs based on these reviews. Information+ 2023 in Edinburgh had 137 submissions, with 32 accepted presentations.</p>
