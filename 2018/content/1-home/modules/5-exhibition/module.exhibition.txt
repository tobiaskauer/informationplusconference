The exhibition focuses on a period of visualization history that was characterized by information overload and growing demands for visual communication in the early 20th century.

Two specific responses are highlighted, each paving the way for a newly established genre of infographics. The Austrians Otto and Marie Neurath, and the German physician Fritz Kahn, developed their distinctive visual languages almost simultaneously, in both cases based on formal stylization of the human body. Neuraths’ “Isotype” utilized pictogram-like graphics as counting units for the quantification of social realities. In contrast Kahn’s “Factories of the Human Body”

Textsecond: The teams around the Austrians Otto & Marie Neurath, and the German physician Fritz Kahn, developed their distinctive visual languages almost simultaneously, in both cases based on formal stylization of the human body. The Neuraths’ “Isotype” utilized pictogram-like graphics as counting units for the quantification of social realities. In contrast Kahn’s “Factories of the Human Body” employed sequences of mechanistically interpreted diagrams, in which the human being was depicted as an “Industrial Palace”.
