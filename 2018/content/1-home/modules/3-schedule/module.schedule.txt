    Inventing the future, one visualization
    at a time
  timedayone: 09:15
  authordayone: Sandra Rendgen
  abstractdayone: >
    Information visualization is a young and
    buzzy field. Much of its creativity and
    research is aimed at mastering new
    technologies, and at supporting
    human-machine interactions of the
    future. Yet in many current professional
    and academic debates, there’s a near
    total lack of historical perspective.
    With everyone looking forward, there’s
    no point in looking back. Or is there?
    Thousands of examples open up a long and
    evocative history of information
    visualization. So, just what do these
    Old Masters have to offer today’s
    visualization designers and researchers?
    When looking to invent the future, is
    there anything to be learned from the
    past? The talk will draw from an
    abundance of material including classics
    like Charles-Joseph Minard and Joseph
    Priestley, but also many unknown
    precursors, to demonstrate how a
    knowledge of history helps to develop a
    critical and sophisticated understanding
    of the practice of information
    visualization.

  titledayone: 'Mixtec pictorial manuscripts: A source of visual information'
  timedayone: 10:00
  authordayone: Claudia Rebeca Méndez Escarza
  abstractdayone: |
    Mexican Pre-Columbian civilizations have written their history using painted language. Some of these manuscripts were painted in Oaxaca where Mixtecs have lived among other pre-Columbian civilizations. Their manuscripts portray information concerning history, location, time, and financial issues.
    <br/><br/>
    These manuscripts have not yet been considered as informative documents; therefore a detailed study is necessary in order to expose the main traits of informational signs and its structure. The main purpose of this paper is to unveil pictorial signs, which convey information, found in historical Mixtec manuscripts. The research will lead to a full understanding of the informational characteristics that those signs contain. It will be done by analyzing a pair of Mixtec painted manuscripts. One that has been painted during Pre-Columbian times (XIV century) and the other circa the second half of the XV century.
    <br/><br/>
    This paper is part of the initial phase of a doctoral degree dissertation concerning information design and visualization.

  titledayone: Quo vadis, Isotype?
  timedayone: 10:20
  authordayone: Günther Schreder + Eva Mayr
  abstractdayone: |
    About 100 years ago, Otto Neurath developed the International System of Typographic Picture Education (ISOTYPE) to visualize statistical data, support education, and communicate social and economic facts and processes in an intuitive way. While Neurath’s ideas inspired InfoVis and are well known among designers, little is known about effects on
    recipients and Isotype has not been systematically applied in InfoVis. The first part of our presentation addresses the cognitive effects of pictorial statistics. The second part will explore future extensions of Isotype into contemporary InfoVis by leveraging animation, storytelling, and interactivity to not only communicate facts, but also support active
    reception and reflective thinking.
    <br/><br/>
    In our talk, we discuss which types of diagrams and visualizations, aside from bar charts and maps, would be suitable for (partial) isotypization. What would storytelling with ISOTYPE look like (film, data documentaries)? Is it possible to take Neurath’s ideas to the 21st century?

    A History of “visual literacy”
    campaigns
  timedayone: 11:20
  authordayone: Sam Holleran
  abstractdayone: |
    This presentation traces the history of “visual literacy” campaigns and the application of the term to a wide variety of programs within design education and the social sciences. It examines educator-created tools that aim to teach students to prune away excess visual information, as well as the position of the viewer in a world increasingly saturated with pictures.
    <br/><br/>
    The presentation will chart several major campaigns from the U.S.—sponsored by libraries, major universities, and NGOs —that sought to define and improve visual literacy beginning in the 1970s. These public interest initiatives shifted the notion of “literacy” from the mass literacy campaigns of the 1960s, to the arena of the visual in the 1970s. In the push for the public to become savvy “knowers” of images, we see a change in the way graphic media is created and visual space is perceived.

  titledayone: The BMJ visual abstracts
  timedayone: 11:40
  authordayone: Will Stahl-Timmins
  abstractdayone: |
    To help time-pressured readers of The British Medical to quickly understand key messages of clinical trials that we publish, we have begun creating visual abstracts. They offer a quick overview of the key points of a paper, and are used on our website, print journal, and social media channels.
    <br/><br/>
    We conducted formative user evaluations to help us determine which information to include. Summative evaluation post-publication has been encouraging. However, it remains to be seen whether this is a sustained pattern, or a halo effect because of the novelty of the visual abstracts. We are cautiously optimistic about the effects of introducing visual abstracts in the journal. We believe that we have managed to strike a balance between the twin evils of information overload and oversimplification of nuanced messages.

    Designing an optimal document in the
    health sector
  timedayone: 12:00
  authordayone: Guillermina Noël + Jorge Frascara
  abstractdayone: |
    Medical personnel usually write and design documents that inform physicians or patients about procedures or therapies. Document design, however, requires skills that are not normally applied, resulting in information that is often not used properly.
    </br></br>
    The Alberta Colorectal Cancer Screening Program commissioned us to re-design existing instructional documents. We reviewed them, developed performance specifications for their re-design, and used an iterative process of prototypes and testing, also resorting to literature on reading comprehension, memorization and use of information, involving plain language, visual perception, page layout, legibility, editorial consistency and use of images.
    </br></br>
    To redesign the document we identified 23 principles based on peer-reviewed research. We tested each iteration with users to ensure ease of use, completeness of information, accuracy and clarity, to facilitate adoption.
    </br></br>
    The document has been downloaded 26,000 times, suggesting a good physician reception. An evaluation of the impact on use of the information by patients is underway.

  titledayone: Adventures in colour coding
  timedayone: 12:25
  abstractdayone: |
    At the end of 2017 we won an international design competition to design the wayfinding system for the Skicircus Saalbach Hintgerglemm Leogang Fieberbrunn, one of the largest ski areas in Austria. A key factor in the project is how to facilitate speed and accuracy in transmitting essential information. Our starting point was the logic of highways, which led us to create a radically reduced standard. These two factors influenced our research and practice into colour coding in skiing areas.
    <br/><br/>
    Colour is an essential tool for us environmental graphic designers and our decisions have a huge impact on the overall system, but there are limitations by way of numerous legal requirements, cultural habits and environmental conditions which restrict the choices.
    <br/><br/>
    In this talk we will show how we faced the challenges posed by these limitations, and how we came up with the colour coding for the different variables that required it, taking into account simplicity, contrast and nameability.

    Connecting people through visualization.
    Creating a data-driven visual identity
    that encourages meaningful interactions
  timedayone: 12:30
  abstractdayone: |
    A fundamental challenge when organizing a conference is how to facilitate the development of purposeful connections, both between and among the audience, the speakers, and their topics. Rather than assigning a specific time and place for people to interact, Visualizing Knowledge Conference 2018 devised a system that encouraged connections through the features of the conference’s identity. Applying User-Centered Design methods, the team developed two visual elements that stimulated the formation of connections: a data-driven shape that revealed each participant’s interest in core aspects of the information design process, and a wordmark that could be extended with the topics addressed at the conference. These nonintrusive elements allowed for an individual pace to human interactions in a large gathering of people.
    <br/><br/>
    The lightning talk will give an overview of the design process, discuss learnings and elaborate on the potential of our approach.

  timedayone: 12:35
  abstractdayone: >
    Not all professionals who work with data
    have the creative skills necessary to
    create an easy to interpret, effective
    visualization strategy. Most
    professionals have a data design
    repository that is limited to
    traditional and overused graphics such
    as pie charts, bar graphs, area charts,
    etc. But what if there was a design tool
    that could help expand their visual
    vocabulary? As an infographic designer
    and information design teacher, in 2017,
    I created the Infographic Wheel. The
    Infographic Wheel is a handheld design
    tool that helps people select a visual
    layout based on the characteristics of
    their dataset. This tool makes
    information design more accessible for
    the average person. As more people gain
    the ability to communicate complex
    topics in inventive ways, we both
    amplify new ideas and increase our
    opportunities as a visual global society
    to communicate more efficiently with
    each other.

    Designers — what are they good for (in
    data visualisation)?
  timedayone: 02:05
  abstractdayone: 'Our focus is the digital humanities, especially visualisation of datasets such as text archives and object collections data in museums. The name “digital humanities” implies just two disciplines, computing and the humanities. What is the designer’s role?  Collectively we should be able to explain what our contribution is —especially when some may fear our replacement by AI systems. We argue that there are particular aspects of designing that are distinctive and can enable more effective visualisations to be produced: (1) expertise in the visual articulation of meaning, (2) human-centric methods, and (3) the quick and adaptable use of low-fidelity early prototyping. We base our argument especially on the idea of design as a form of inquiry or research, and illustrate the three benefits using our recent interactive data visualisations with organisations including the Wellcome Library, Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum and V&A London.'

  titledayone: 'Feeling numbers: The emotional impact of proximity techniques in visualization'
  timedayone: 02:25
  abstractdayone: >
    Data visualizations are used as
    rhetorical instruments, but how they
    persuade has yet to be fully understood.
    In scholarly critique, persuasion in
    visualizations has been negatively
    related to concepts like bias and
    deception. However, when considering
    visualization as a form of
    communication, persuasion is a natural
    and critical part of conveying a
    message. Of Aristotle’s three modes of
    persuasion, the appeal to emotions has
    been the most overlooked in rhetoric
    research of information visualization.
    We present empirical research which
    validates the ability of visualizations
    to appeal to emotions through proximity
    techniques. The findings indicate that
    the framing of data matters, that people
    feel greater interest towards a topic
    when the visualized data are more
    relevant to them, and that data
    representing events closer in time are
    more affecting. This research takes a
    step towards improving our understanding
    on the use and impact of techniques that
    appeal to emotions in visualization.

  titledayone: 'Belief at first sight: Data visualization and the rationalization of seeing'
  timedayone: 02:45
  abstractdayone: >
    Data visualization has been increasingly
    represented in public discourse as an
    objective proof of facts. However,
    visualization is only a single
    translation of reality. It is crucial
    that we consider why data visualization
    has been primarily thought of as truth,
    irrespective of the origin of the data,
    its processing, the choices made by
    designers, developers and clients, or
    its display context. We reflect
    theoretically on data visualization as a
    system of representation historically
    anchored in science and rationalism. It
    establishes itself within a lineage of
    conventions for visual representation
    grounded in objectivity and rationality,
    which extends from the Renaissance
    perspective to the present passing
    through the photographic image, movies,
    TV, and finally computer graphics. By
    starting a discussion about the tendency
    to see a “natural” credibility in
    data visualization rooted in its
    historical context, we might broaden our
    approach to presenting data
    visualizations in the public discourse.

  timedayone: 03:10
  abstractdayone: |
    In this presentation, we give a brief summary of a study to draw the attention to the challenging perception of the two public information pictograms: “elevator” and “toilet”. In wayfinding and on signage, both indicate the location of a destination. Although the semantic information is completely different, both pictograms partly visualize the same: Front view of standing human figures. On signs and in certain contexts this can lead to confusion.
    </br></br>
    The representation of human figures is increasingly being questioned on the basis of public and political discussions on gender issues. Moreover, attention to accessibility is also strongly incorporated in these two pictograms. Thus, both pictograms are in an evolution process in order to meet current requirements. Do more messages require a more complex pictogram? How far can we go?
    </br></br>
    We envision that this study will raise awareness of the handling of these pictograms and point out trends for future visualization.

  timedayone: 04:10
  abstractdayone: >
    Canning —picking up cans and bottles
    on the streets for a living— has been
    an increasingly popular activity in New
    York City for over 30 years, becoming an
    indirect welfare system created and
    sustained by redeeming garbage, worth 5
    cents apiece. Over the past year,
    journalist Francesca Berardi followed a
    group of canners in their daily
    activity, collecting qualitative and
    quantitative information about their
    work. They come in the forms of
    handwritten notes, sketches, oral
    history interviews, photos, videos, and
    GPS tracks of their itineraries. We Can
    combines the aforementioned media into
    an interactive and immersive web
    experience. As the stories of canners
    unfold across mental maps of the city
    that take shape through illustration,
    analogue data visualization, and oral
    history, we push for new and
    experimental forms of urban storytelling
    that explores a more co-owned narrative
    through pairing geospatial data with the
    extraordinary nuances of human lives and
    experiences.

  timedayone: 04:30
  abstractdayone: |
    I’ve learned that after more than ten years working in news, the lessons I’ve learned as a journalist are infinitely applicable to every field. Implementing the tools, techniques and perspectives of a journalist makes a story more cohesive and more comprehensible to an audience. At the center of this philosophy is to simply understand readers and to anticipate their needs.
    <br/><br/>
    As journalists, our job is to understand what information readers would value the most and communicate with them appropriately. At National Geographic, we regularly must make esoteric information more comprehensible to a non-expert, but enthusiastic audience.
    <br/><br/>
    In this session, I’ll talk about some of the skills I’ve learned as a journalist. I’ll show some of my favorite science graphics from National Geographic and talk about the path we took to produce the visual story. I’ll review how to report and visualize your data for stronger, clearer and more cohesive narratives.

That doesn’t mean forgetting the value of the text, the power of other visual formats like video, illustration or photo, the advantages of an attractive design, the eventual bells and whistles or even the little charts and locators that make the day-to-day of a newsroom. Narrative structure, constant edition, rigor, but also originality, boldness and fun are the pillars of, not a collection of individuals, but a team created with diversity of skills and backgrounds in mind: cartographers, engineers, writers, data reporters, designers, graphics artists … but journalists first.'

  timedaytwo: 09:30
  abstractdaytwo: "Machine learning is playing an increasingly influential role in the world due to dramatic technical leaps in recent years. But these new developments bring their own questions. How can we understand what is going on under the hood of deep neural networks? How can we better debug these systems? How can we broaden the conversation about ML-enabled automated decision making? It turns out that visualization can play a central role in answering these questions. We'll discuss recent work that shows how interactive exploration can help people use, interpret, and learn about machine intelligence."

    Peakspotting — a visual tool for
    managing the capacity of Germany’s
    rail traffic network
  timedaytwo: 10:15
  abstractdaytwo: |
    The Peak Spotting software combines machine learning and visual analytics to help manage Germany’s rail traffic network. The project allows yield and capacity managers to identify potential bottlenecks based on passenger load predictions. It provides actionable information to several teams through data exploration and collaboration features, which contribute directly to improving planning and management.
    <br/><br/>
    In this talk, we present a design case study and share our lessons learned in enabling innovation in complex corporate settings. We will discuss the full design and development process of the tool from ideation, data and concept exploration over design and implementation to usage tracking and iterative refinement.
    <br/><br/>
    Of particular interest is the role of automation and analytics tools in digital transformation processes — how can we facilitate the transition from manual work and implicit knowledge to higher level tasks, supported by algorithms and visual analytics tools? And how does this change operational processes and job profiles?

  timedaytwo: 10:35
  abstractdaytwo: |
    “Who Wants to be a Self-Driving Car?” is a data driven trust exercise aiming to explore the technology behind self-driving cars from a human perspective. It uses real-time, three dimensional mapping and object recognition to help people navigate through space. This data is presented to the driver via a virtual reality headset, putting the driver into the position of the control unit of the vehicle.
    <br/><br/>
    The talk will be about the idea and intention behind the project, also giving insight into how the vehicle works. After gaining an overview of the technical setup, we will lay out and discuss design decisions and key takeaways from the experience of “seeing the world through the eyes of a self-driving car”. Finally we will talk about the experience we have gathered showcasing the experience to different audiences, along with approaches on formalizing the debate around humanizing technology in autonomous systems.

    Designing for algorithm awareness in
    peer production systems
  timedaytwo: 11:35
  abstractdaytwo: >
    Algorithms increasingly impact human
    decision-making by stimulating,
    informing, controlling and reacting to
    human activities, thus, necessitating
    the need for algorithm explainability.
    In this project, we investigate the
    RECOIN (Relative Completeness Indicator)
    tool as a use case for algorithm
    awareness; a current topic delineating
    the extent to which a person is
    contextually aware of the existence and
    function of algorithms. RECOIN is a tool
    for Wikidata, a collaborative knowledge
    base that stores structured data and
    supports numerous Wikimedia projects.
    RECOIN aims to augment human
    decision-making on data contributions by
    measuring the relative completeness of
    data items and by recommending potential
    contributions. With concerns over
    encoded cultural bias, RECOIN reflects
    the complexities of co-evolving social
    and algorithmic governance mechanisms.
    Addressing these issues, we showcase
    three distinct visualisation designs of
    RECOIN through the lens of algorithm
    awareness and discuss experimental
    findings regarding their varying effects
    on human decision-making and
    understanding.

    Simulated dendrochronology of immigrants
    and natural-borns in the United States,
    showing the fifty states (1790–2016)
  timedaytwo: 11:55
  abstractdaytwo: >
    Immigrants are central to the identity
    of the United States, the population of
    which has grown in number and diversity
    as a function of new arrivals from
    around the globe. In this communication,
    we go through the design process, the
    implementation, and the ongoing results
    of a visualization project leveraging
    arboreal visual metaphors to explore the
    contribution of immigrants to the
    country’s population. Immigrants and
    native-born persons are represented and
    differentiated as cells in trees, with
    layered annual rings capturing patterns
    of population growth. These rings
    register, in their shape and color,
    certain environmental conditions. In
    order to mimic the natural process by
    which growth rings are formed (the
    science of which is called
    dendrochronology), our project devises a
    computational system that generates tree
    rings as if cells were data-units.

    Techniques for adding diverse contextual
    data into visualizations
  timedaytwo: 12:15
  abstractdaytwo: |
    Many current visualizations focus on a few data variables and simple representations for rapid visual perception. But many real-world problems require multi-variate decisions. While interactions can help explore contextual information —the context can only be uncovered if explicitly sought, meaning that it can be missed.
    <br/><br/>
    Instead, there are many historic visualization approaches which bring together heterogeneous data into high dimensional, data-dense plots, such as atlas maps, genealogical diagrams, detailed tables and railway timetables for analytical applications such as planning journeys, tracing relationships, extrapolating properties, and managing operations. A review of historic examples show contextual techniques, such as: shared coordinates to facilitate placement of data; enhanced multivariate marks such as icons or text; flexibility of layout and content to locate related information legibly; use of cues to facilitate macro and micro patterns; and use of differentiated markers that can be perceptually filtered to facilitate comparison across entities.

  titledaytwo: 'Visualizing philosophy: A modern design approach to understand I-Ching'
  timedaytwo: 01:55
  abstractdaytwo: |
    This project uses text mining and interactive data visualization techniques to reveal new patterning insights of the ancient Chinese text I-Ching from both divinatory and philosophical perspectives. The implication of the hexagram patterns and their correlations with the commentaries are analyzed through text mining. The macro/micro visualization design strategy offers a comprehensive interactive experience to the viewers and sheds new light on this ancient book.
    <br/><br/>
    The goal of the project is to overcome cultural and language barriers, and investigate more innovative methods to objectively analyze and interpret I-Ching than language translations. The visualization approach and research process explore four aspects of I-Ching: the geometrical patterns of the Hexagrams, the semantics of the Hexagrams, the occurrences of keywords related to divination, and the thematic categories of the Decisions. Visualizing abstract text information that is polysemic and sometimes uncertain provides a new way to view and understand I-Ching and Chinese philosophy that can reach to a wide range of audiences.

    Participatory data visualizations
    support intercultural collaboration
  timedaytwo: 02:15
  abstractdaytwo: >
    Although tools for working across
    distance and time are prevalent,
    inexpensive, and accessible to many,
    their existence does not guarantee
    successful intercultural work.
    Culturally attuned methods are the
    missing ingredient to bring design teams
    together across geographic and social
    borders. Participatory information
    visualizations —created by students or
    professional design practitioners
    involved in intercultural
    collaborations— can contribute
    significantly to a shared sense of
    community. The authors’ ongoing
    research has produced several
    participatory visualization methods; one
    recent method that holds great promise
    is the High-Low Context Matrix. Created
    in real time through a combination of
    physical and digital tools, this matrix
    shows how each participant maps along
    the cultural continuums developed by
    anthropologist Edward T. Hall, and helps
    participants envision each other as a
    collaborative community. The information
    visualization results in energized
    discussion among cross-cultural
    teammates —they begin to investigate
    culturally determined attitudes and
    linguistic patterns that shape
    communication, personality dynamics, and
    educational goals.

  titledaytwo: 'Qualitative data visualization: The Entity Mapper'
  timedaytwo: 02:35
  abstractdaytwo: >
    This paper introduces how we can develop
    data visualization in qualitative
    research with an example of a software
    that was developed by Dr. Anne Luther
    and her team at the Parsons Institute
    for Information Mapping at The New
    School in New York, today’s Center for
    Data Arts. The Entity Mapper is a data
    visualization tool that makes data
    visually accessible without losing the
    complex and manual character of
    qualitative analysis. Many of the
    methods used to access, understand, and
    analyze qualitative data are based on
    relational links between unstructured
    data, and abstracted concepts
    researchers develop. Understanding how
    node-and-link visualizations might be
    helpful for mapping relational data, the
    Entity Mapper visualizes semiconstrained
    relational networks using qualitative
    data exported from Atlas.ti. The Entity
    Mapper is an open source project
    published on GitHUB.

  timedaytwo: 03:00
  abstractdaytwo: |
    Modal is a research tool for annotating complex structures in texts. It enables users to develop multiple perspectives on texts by allowing them to annotate and categorise passages into self-defined structures. Based on insights gained in collaborative workshops with literary scholars and students, Modal introduces a way to analyse text fragments isolated from their original context in different columns assigned by the user. With this comprehensive analysis, users gain a superior understanding of texts during research.
    <br/><br/>
    The user interface provides multiple visualisation perspectives: a distant view of all annotations, a classic close reading and several cut-up views comprised of the individual passages and their distributions within the document. The interaction concept strives for a rich user experience with an elaborate typographical use and a tested intuitive user flow.

  timedaytwo: 03:05
  abstractdaytwo: 'The human genome is about 2 meters long and tightly folded into the cell nucleus, a sphere that is 4 million times smaller than a pinhead. How do cells avoid entangling the DNA and ensure accessibility of necessary parts? Biologists study DNA folding through the detection of pairwise physical interactions along the DNA, which results in a 3-by-3 million pixel matrix. Visualized as a heatmap, thousands of local visual patterns become apparent. Yet studying these patterns is like trying to understand the average layout of parks while viewing countries on a world map. Biologists need to inspect these patterns for sensemaking of biological features. We have developed 3 interactive tools to explore such large datasets at different steps: (1) seamless browsing using HiGlass; (2) local pattern exploration through decomposition in HiPiler; and (3) guided navigation with Scalable Insets. I will present our tools and discuss the generalizability of their underlying concepts.'

  timedaytwo: 03:10
  abstractdaytwo: 'What lessons can the mechanical split-flap board, a.k.a. the Solari board, offer for digital information design? Solari boards were ubiquitous for decades in train stations and airports around the world. Their distinctive combination of motion and sound made them so popular that many modern transport hubs now feature digital versions with the same structure and constraints as the originals. In this talk I will analyze the Solari board’s visual design in the context of design theory and in comparison with other familiar displays, including stock market ticker tapes and stadium scoreboards. I will argue that creators of data visualizations can learn from three aspects of the Solari board’s transitions: prolonged sensory stimuli, which draw the viewer’s attention; a simple algorithm by which the board changes states; and the board’s economy of space, which is made possible by the middle split and its use of depth.'

  titledaytwo: Data feminism
  timedaytwo: 04:00
  abstractdaytwo: |
    Data visualizations can dazzle, inform, and persuade. It is precisely this power that makes it worth asking: "Visualization by whom? For whom? In whose interest? Informed by whose values?" These are some of the questions that emerge from what we call data feminism, a way of thinking about data and its visualization that is informed by the past several decades of intersectional feminist activism and thinking.
    <br/><br/>
    Using visualization as a starting point, this paper works backwards through the data-processing pipeline in order to show how a feminist approach to thinking about data not only exposes how power and privilege presently operate in data science, but also suggests how different design principles can help to expose inequality, mitigate bias, and work towards justice. In the process, we discuss the talented journalists, artists, data scientists and communities that are at the forefront of data-driven justice.

    Lost in the universe of graphical
    objects? Critical visualisation,
    disciplinary myopias and the
    visualisation spectrum
  timedaytwo: 04:20
  abstractdaytwo: >
    When do graphs become visualisations?
    What do visualisations visualise? This
    talk investigates how we ask these
    questions through the “Universe of
    Graphical Objects” (UGO); a
    hyper-volume containing the infinite
    possible variations and permutations of
    graphical objects from which
    visualisations are selected. Different
    disciplines attempt to probe and sample
    this universe, but with different
    theories, methods and objectives. Which
    locations and zones are good, bad or
    ugly? Different disciplines do not have
    to agree on this mapping and UGO invites
    us to reflect on what we know about its
    graphical properties and how. As each
    disciplinary framing enables a clearer
    picture of visualisation we can
    simultaneously developed disciplinary
    myopia, which limit what we can look for
    in UGO and what we find. If we look out
    from UGO, our graphical universe, and
    onto our disciplines, can we make new
    interdisciplinary connections? Are there
    alternative ways to understand which
    graphical objects “visualise”?

  titledaytwo: 'Decoding space: Liquid infrastructures'
  timedaytwo: 04:45
  abstractdaytwo: |
    Artificially intelligent systems (AI) are increasingly the ubiquitous, unseen arbiters of our social, civic and family lives. Ever increasing computational power, combined with almost limitless data, has led to a turning point in the way artificial intelligence assists, judges and cares for humans. But in the wake of such power we must ask, what are we making inherently unknowable as the world becomes more predictable, managed, and discrete? And what does it look like to spatialize memories, knowledge, and experiences of urban geographies that lie outside of the algorithm?
    <br/><br/>
    “Decoding Space: Liquid Infrastructures,” meditates on redlining, a popular narrative of post-WWII economic segregation and a conceptual framework that is often engaged to explain contemporary patterns of poverty and racial segregation. This keynote engages redlining and subaltern geographies as a critical intervention in reframing race, space, knowledge, and data.
