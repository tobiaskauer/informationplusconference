                    <h3>A design exhibition held at the Information+ conference </h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        At the Information+ exhibition we aim at showcasing recent contributions to the visual and
                        material
                        communication of information. We are looking for thought-provoking or radically designed pieces
                        that
                        derive from collaboration among disciplines, or from an interdisciplinary practice. We are
                        welcoming
                        individual or group submissions of data representation and visualization pieces in which the
                        main
                        intent is the communication of information. These pieces will be showcased during the
                        Information+
                        conference at <a href="https://inspace.ed.ac.uk">Inspace</a>, an exhibition space of the
                        Institute
                        of Design Informatics at the University
                        of Edinburgh.
                    </p>
                    <p>We welcome submissions in a multitude of mediums such as video (projected or displayed),
                        interactive
                        technology, physical and sculptural, drawings and illustrations, and digital prints.
                        Additionally,
                        we are also interested in showcasing the design process behind some of the featured pieces,
                        together
                        with all their dead-ends and accidental designs. If the work has been exhibited before, we will
                        ask
                        you to disclose this, and favor a new framing or interpretation linking the work to the
                        conference
                        and the exhibition.
                    </p>
                    <p>We are looking for a broad diversity of contributions, people, and topics, and we especially
                        encourage practitioners, designers, artists, academics, and others who are not usually
                        represented
                        at visualization and other data-oriented venues. A limited example of practices and applications
                        we
                        are looking for are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Communication of science</li>
                        <li>Data journalism and storytelling</li>
                        <li>Design studies and visual explorations</li>
                        <li>Digital humanities</li>
                        <li>Automated (AI) visualizations</li>
                        <li>Materiality of visualizations (i.e. physicalizations or performances)</li>
                        <li>Graphic systems for data representation</li>
                        <li>Metaphoric portrayals of data</li>
                        <li>Data-embedded architecture, situated or environmental data</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>The work will be selected by the Exhibition chairs in consultation with the conferenceâ€™s
                        organizing
                        committee. All accepted work will be featured on this website, and in an online and printed
                        catalog.
                        Authors of the pieces will be asked to give a short artist talk introducing their work at the
                        opening of the exhibition. The authors will work with the conference organizers on details for
                        showcasing their pieces in the exhibition. Exhibiting artists will get complimentary
                        registrations
                        to the Information+ conference. No artist fees are provided. If accepted, we can subsidize
                        travel
                        costs in certain cases: please reach out to the Exhibition chairs if you donâ€™t have a supporting
                        institution to subsidize your travel expenses.</p>
