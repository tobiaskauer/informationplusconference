                                                            Yet, most of our visualisation knowledge is mainly based on
                                                            LTR readers. In contrast, RTL readers constitute over 500
                                                            million worldwide and are left out of empirical

                                                            experience with RTL designs. Running a quick search on the
                                                            internet for visualisation guidelines for RTL readers shows
                                                            how designers struggle and sometimes receive conflicting and
                                                            faulty information on how to mirror guidelines. The World

                                                            replicate that experience. However, we must critically ask

                                                            University in Spring 2023. It focused on the intersection of
                                                            data visualization and art within the realm of immersive
                                                            media, with a specific focus on augmented reality (AR). The
                                                            presentation entails course design, outcomes, acquired

                                                            in data and storytelling, showcasing its transformative

                                                            creativity. This pilot class functioned as a testing ground
                                                            for innovative tools and learning methodologies, with the

                                                            The course design was guided by two inquiries. How does AR
                                                            enhance data visualization and storytelling, and what tools
                                                            and techniques can be used effectively in this context? What

                                                            need to design AR experiences with data?

                                                            with a very broad definition: data visualizations are a
                                                            consistent mapping between data values and visual
                                                            components. This broad definition certainly encompasses the
                                                            kinds of charts and graphs which first come to mind when
                                                            imagining a visualization, but what about memes which borrow
                                                            the language of data visualization to talk about dating

                                                            use and queer use, in this presentation I will argue that
                                                            representing data visually is a required, but not
                                                            sufficient, condition for something to be considered a “data

                                                            and propose that both intended and queer uses are worth

                                                        <p>Monroe N. Work was an African American sociologist, scholar,
                                                            and researcher who spent his life collecting information and

                                                            was the nine editions of the Negro Year Book between 1912
                                                            and 1938. Each edition was an encyclopedic collection of
                                                            yearly facts and data that covered many aspects of African

                                                            remains less known than his contemporaries W.E.B. Du Bois
                                                            and Booker T. Washington despite collaborating with both.
                                                            After sharing research with Du Bois early in his career,
                                                            Work went on to start the Department of Records and Research
                                                            at the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, presided

                                                            perspectives. Thus, it is imperative to discuss how the

                                                            of treating a common challenge in information design and
                                                            data visualization: missing data. Through an exchange among
                                                            different epistemological fields, theories and methods, our
                                                            work challenges the assumption that data should be clean or
                                                            whole, and instead advocates for the possibility to treat
                                                            missing data as its own knowledge object. We focus these

                                                            uses astronomical data from around the world to provide the

                                                            not capture the full universe due to the limitations of
                                                            current observational instruments, and narrators of
                                                            OpenSpace planetarium shows fill the gaps with stories of
                                                            why the data is missing. Our analysis of OpenSpace reveals
                                                            an opportunity to use missing data as an opportunity to

                                                            For most people, dashboarding products is not the first
                                                            thing to come to mind.
                                                            Yet, our interdisciplinary product team set sail to provide
                                                            a more joyful building experience for our users.

                                                        <p>Visualising otherwise is a respond to current trends in
                                                            visualisation culture, exploring data representation from
                                                            media and image studies. It challenges the dominant model of
                                                            visualisation that rigidly presents data, proposing an
                                                            alternative diagram-theoretical approach. Hence, we see
                                                            visualisations as ordering processes, revealing their

                                                            perspectives, it emphasises transformative concepts over
                                                            rigid efficiency and optimisation. The presentation seeks
                                                            critical models to explore limits and possibilities of

                                                            practitioners. Researchers will learn about the nature of
                                                            design practice including strategies for engaging in

                                                            that may sensitize them to aspects of their practice and

                                        video service, can yield useful insights and help designers improve the
                                        effectiveness of online and offline services. When we explore such data,
                                        we’re
                                        often interested in not just what actions people performed but whether
                                        those
                                        actions enabled users to meet their needs. The aim of this workshop is
                                        to
                                        explore how these datasets might be examined in a way that includes such
                                        human
                                        values. This could enrich the insights derived from the analysis, by
                                        determining
                                        which core human needs and drivers are being fulfilled, or undermined.
                                        Putting
                                        the people behind the data at the centre of the analysis in this way,
                                        helps
                                        avoid the user reflected in the data being reduced to just their clicks

                                        practitioners and researchers the kinds of values they wish to find in

                                        data and explore ways of dealing with their data which could support
                                        these kinds

                                        informed to consider these issues in the context of their own practice,

                                        representational
                                        exercises but also as cultural techniques. We’ll delve into the
                                        intricate
                                        tapestry of data representation, uncovering inherent limitations and
                                        their
                                        far-reaching individual and societal implications – to look at the
                                        complex
                                        assemblages behind the data images.</p>
                                    <p>

                                        Spanning three phases, the workshop commences with input presentations,
                                        spanning
                                        diverse philosophical perspectives on data and its visual portrayal.
                                        This
                                        knowledge sets the stage for the second phase, where participants
                                        dissect
                                        existing visualisations – personal or inspirational – dissecting
                                        strengths,
                                        limitations, and kindling enriching discussions. The final phase widens
                                        the
                                        vista to encompass societal dimensions. Addressing visualisation
                                        challenges
                                        evolves into an exploration of their profound societal impact, fostering
                                        strategies to transcend limitations. The workshop seamlessly weaves
                                        theory and
                                        practice, nurturing a discerning approach. It empowers participants to
                                        adeptly
                                        navigate the cultural and societal nuances entwined with data
                                        visualisation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        The workshop bridges the theory-practice gap in visualisation design,
                                        offering
                                        an alternative data visualisation vocabulary. By examining limitations
                                        and
                                        consequences, we encourage holistic thinking beyond technical aspects.
                                        We’ll
                                        embrace cultural and societal dimensions to provoke a more
                                        self-reflective
                                        visualisation practice. Equipped with a critical lens, participants
                                        emerge as
                                        conscious, informed practitioners, enriching the broader data
                                        visualisation
                                        discourse.

                                        and co-creation, this workshop will explore ways to rethink data from
                                        'data as a
                                        resource for information processing or analysis' to 'data as a medium
                                        that can
                                        lead to social change'. Participants will record their plastic use
                                        through a
                                        probe kit that is carefully designed to document individual data,
                                        reflections,
                                        and behaviours. The filled out kits will act as the basis for the
                                        workshop which
                                        will follow a series of co-creative activities such as Behaviour
                                        Reasoning, Data
                                        Meshworking, and Co-Speculating. Through this workshop, participants
                                        will learn
                                        how to experience data, how to extend their perspectives and actions
                                        into the
                                        larger social and environmental context, and how to build tools to take
                                        action
                                        toward a more sustainable community.</p>
                                    <p>* Participants will receive a digital probe kit prior to the workshop and
                                        will
                                        conduct plastic data tracking for 3 days.

                                    <p>Memes, often characterized by their humorous and viral nature, have
                                        become a
                                        widespread form of online expression, shaping the way we engage with and
                                        understand contemporary issues. “Memes for Feminist Data Literacy”
                                        explores the
                                        immense potential of memes as a critical and transformative tool for
                                        feminist

                                        feminist data futures should be seeked through critical and creative

                                        methods, mediums, tools and tactics that unpack, communicate and

                                        memes for various aspects of feminist data literacy. By embracing the

                                        creativity of meme culture, we will explore the power of memes in
                                        sparking
                                        critical conversations, raising awareness, mobilizing communities, and

                                        In a this workshop, we will delve into how memes; an online medium that
                                        has been
                                        predominantly driven by and amplifying the voices of patriarchal norms
                                        and
                                        communities, can be adopted to challenge the inequalities in access to
                                        data
                                        literacy, introduce feminist perspectives to the data and amplify
                                        underrepresented perspectives by actively creating memes and
                                        contributing to the
                                        feminist data literacy meme archive.

                                        physicalization prompted by values i.e. what someone considers important

                                        values as

                                        and Alenka Gucek founded more than one year ago.
                                        The main goal of the workshop is to practice dataviz skills, challenging
                                        ourselves in data storytelling, starting from personal data. They will
                                        create a
                                        data viz, telling the story behind the data they collected. The main
                                        goal is to
                                        make the data viz speak by itself.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        During the workshop, the participants will collect data about what's
                                        around
                                        them, letting them focus on themselves, and getting into an
                                        introspective
                                        process. They will be led to look at things from everyday life from a
                                        different
                                        perspective, changing the way they perceive themselves and their habits.

                                    <p>In Europe, every medicine package contains a leaflet. This leaflet must
                                        mention
                                        the frequency and severity of side effects. At the moment, this is done
                                        through
                                        obligatory phrases like: ‘Very common: may affect more than 1 in 10
                                        people’,
                                        ‘Common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people’ and ‘Uncommon: may affect up
                                        to 1 in
                                        100 people.’ Most patients don’t understand these descriptions and
                                        overestimate
                                        the risks of taking a medicine. This information is provided only on
                                        paper and
                                        only in words. It is not digital and not visual.

                                        The goal and challenge of the workshop is to visualise the “frequency”
                                        and
                                        “severity” of side effects to inform patients in a balanced manner. The
                                        data
                                        from clinical studies for one medicine will be used as a basis. We’ll
                                        discuss
                                        the practical issues, look at a few existing examples, and explore
                                        digital and
                                        visual approaches. How can we inform patients about side effects in a
                                        balanced
                                        manner that is understandable and usable? What could interactive
                                        information
                                        about side effects look like?

                                        impact of conventional data physicalization creation through practices
                                        that
                                        emphasise the responsible and reflective use of materials. Participants
                                        will
                                        engage in group activities to craft their own eco-friendly data
                                        physicalizations, before discussing their experiences and opinions on
                                        the wider
                                        topic of sustainability in data physicalization creation. The workshop
                                        intends
                                        to foster knowledge sharing, discussions on the benefits and challenges
                                        of
                                        adopting zero-waste strategies, and identification of future
                                        opportunities for
                                        integrating sustainability into data physicalization education and
                                        practices.
                                        Our aim is for the workshop to inspire participants to rethink their
                                        approaches
                                        to workshops, teaching, and prototyping in the context of data
                                        physicalization.
                                        Furthermore, the workshop may lead to the formation of a Special
                                        Interest Group
                                        (SIG) focused on sustainability and data physicalization. Future
                                        research
                                        directions include enabling individuals to create their own ZeroWaste
                                        PhysKits
                                        and exploring similar sustainable approaches for dynamic physicalization
                                        designs.

                                        goals can be
                                        a challenging task. In this workshop, we introduce a hands-on
                                        activity that
                                        guides through the process of understanding the essential building
                                        blocks of a
                                        visualization to crafting design variations. This workshop builds on
                                        the 'DNA of
                                        Visualization' framework that helps designers to generate
                                        visualizations options
                                        and to guide design choices. This framework uses the metaphorical
                                        concept of the
                                        “Visualization zoo” that was introduced by Jeffrey Heer et al.,
                                        along with the
                                        idea of all visualization ‘species’ sharing a common ‘DNA’. By
                                        defining the
                                        fundamental building blocks of visualization, their
                                        interrelationships and their
                                        various combinatorial possibilities, the framework provides a method
                                        for
                                        deconstructing visualizations and a grammar that supports the
                                        exploration of the
                                        design space and guides the designer in finding appropriate
                                        visualization
                                        variations.
                                        <br>Building on a deconstruction and construction approach
                                        demonstrated, for
                                        instance, in the interface construction kit workshop, the workshop
                                        will include
                                        two phases to guide designers through the design process: (1) a
                                        deconstruction
                                        phase to help understanding a given ‘visualization species’ (chart
                                        type) by
                                        identifying its building blocks, such as the visual encoding
                                        techniques, the
                                        visual components and the types of information it encodes. (2) a
                                        construction
                                        phase that helps the designer to explore the design space to create
                                        different
                                        visualization variations. This design process is supported by a
                                        grammar that
                                        provides designers with guidance on how to combine VisDNA building
                                        blocks.
                                        <br>The workshop is suited for practitioners and educators in the
                                        area of
                                        information visualization and design. It provides a grammar that can
                                        be used to
                                        understand the key aspects of a visualization and supports the
                                        exploration of
                                        the design space. The workshop material includes worksheets and a
                                        guided process
                                        to help designers to find an appropriate chart type for a given data
                                        set and to
                                        create and sketch other suitable design variations.

                    <h3>A design exhibition held at the Information+ conference </h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        At the Information+ exhibition we aim at showcasing recent contributions to the visual
                        and
                        material
                        communication of information. We are looking for thought-provoking or radically designed
                        pieces
                        that
                        derive from collaboration among disciplines, or from an interdisciplinary practice. We
                        are
                        welcoming
                        individual or group submissions of data representation and visualization pieces in which
                        the
                        main
                        intent is the communication of information. These pieces will be showcased during the
                        Information+
                        conference at <a href="https://inspace.ed.ac.uk">Inspace</a>, an exhibition space of the
                        Institute
                        of Design Informatics at the University
                        of Edinburgh.
                    </p>
                    <p>We welcome submissions in a multitude of mediums such as video (projected or displayed),
                        interactive
                        technology, physical and sculptural, drawings and illustrations, and digital prints.
                        Additionally,
                        we are also interested in showcasing the design process behind some of the featured
                        pieces,
                        together
                        with all their dead-ends and accidental designs. If the work has been exhibited before,
                        we will
                        ask
                        you to disclose this, and favor a new framing or interpretation linking the work to the
                        conference
                        and the exhibition.

                        <p class="text">Information+ 2023 will take place in Edinburgh, Scotland. Edinburgh is the
                            capital city of Scotland,
                            and the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament and the highest courts
                            in
                            Scotland.
                            It is also a city of UNESCO World Heritage, and invites for walks through the medieval
                            streets of Old Town
                            and the Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill. Located
                            at
                            the southern
                            shore of the Firth of Forth, the city is said to be built on seven hills, Blackford
                            Hill,
                            Arthur's Seat and the Castle Rock among them.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text">The city is and has long been a centre of education, particularly in
                            medicine,

                            philosophy, the sciences, and engineering. In 2004 it was declared the first UNESCO City
                            of
                            Literature;
                            for centuries Edinburgh has inspired writers from Sir Walter Scot, Robert Luis
                            Stevensen, to
                            Muriel Spark,
                            Irvine Welsh and Ian Rankin, just to name a few.
