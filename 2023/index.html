                        thought-provoking, and interdisciplinary conversations about information design and data
                        visualization, including their design, assessment, and implications for society. We are looking
                        for
                        diverse positions and topics, and we especially encourage submissions from practitioners,

                                <p>Examining and visualising large datasets, such as user analytics for a web-based video service, can yield useful insights and help designers improve the effectiveness of online and offline services. When we explore such data, we’re often interested in not just what actions people performed but whether those actions enabled users to meet their needs. The aim of this workshop is to explore how these datasets might be examined in way that includes such human values. This could enrich the insights derived from the analysis, by determining which core human needs and drivers are being fulfilled, or undermined. Putting the people behind the data at the centre of the analysis in this way, helps avoid the user reflected in the date being reduced to just their clicks and views. The workshop will give participants the ability to discuss with other practitioners and researchers the kinds of values they wish to find in their data and explore ways of dealing with their data which could support these kinds of analyses.</p>

Participants should feel supported and informed to consider these issues in the context of their own practice, interests and experience and create visualisations that reflect their concerns. Participants will engage in a discussion about data ethics and advocacy, learning more about these issues and sharing their experiences with other community members. They will also make an output which articulates some of their perspectives, stimulating discussion and debate in the workshop and wider conference.</p>

                               <p>In 2015 author and researcher Alexander Galloway questioned the possibilities of data visualization in his writing ‘Are Some Things Unrepresentable?’. This question is debated in areas such as media theory, diagrammatics, and more generally philosophy. But intriguingly this discourse is not active in the practical side of designing data visualizations. By delving into the intrinsic limitations and consequences of the visualization process, we aim to develop a vocabulary that is able to tackle the core issues of graphic representations of data. The primary goal of this workshop is to inspire a critical perspective on data visualizations, considering them not only as mere technical or representational exercises but also as cultural techniques. Through this sensitive approach, we seek to foster a deeper understanding of data visualizations as a medium, encouraging participants to critically engage with their practice and consider the broader societal implications of their work. By fostering discussions around the limitations and consequences of visualization processes, the workshop challenges participants to think beyond the technical and representational aspects and consider the cultural and societal dimensions of their work. It encourages a more holistic understanding of data visualizations as a medium, empowering participants to create visualizations that not only communicate effectively but also ethically and responsibly. By equipping participants with a critical lens, the workshop aims to foster a more conscious and informed community of data visualization practitioners who can navigate the complexities of the field and contribute meaningfully to the broader discourse surrounding data visualization.</p>

                                 <p>"For My Friend, Earth: Rethinking Data and Behaviour in a Plastic World" is a two-part workshop that will lead participants in a process of generating and experiencing data as a means to surface common values and imagine actions to reduce and transform contemporary issues of plastic waste. Combining tactics of Data Embodying, Data Biography, and Data Persona with design methods like probe kits and co-creation, this workshop will explore ways to rethink data from 'data as a resource for information processing or analysis' to 'data as a medium that can lead to social change'. During the conference, participants will record their plastic use through a probe kit that is carefully designed to document individual data, reflections, and behaviours. The filled out kits will act as the basis for the workshop which will follow a series of co-creative activities such as Behaviour Reasoning and Speculating, Data Meshworking, and Co-Making. Through this workshop, participants will learn how to experience data, how to extend their perspectives and actions into the larger social and environmental context, and how to build tools to take action toward a more sustainable community.</p>

Participants will create a physical or digital data viz, telling the story behind the data they collected. The main goal is to make the data viz speak by itself. During the workshop, the participants will collect data about themselves or what's around them, letting them focus on themselves, and getting into an introspective process. They will be led to look at things from everyday life from a different perspective, changing the way they perceive themselves and their habits. Also, they will practice their collecting and visualizing skills, improving their confidence in data viz.</p>

                                 <p>The goal of the workshop is to create opportunities for connection among the Info+ community through reflective physicalization prompted by values. Value represents what a person considers important in the context of their work, drives decision-making and informs negotiation. With the reflective physicalization approach we draw on values as elements that foreground the socio-technical context of knowledge creation and foster tangible thinking. Typically the interaction opportunities at conferences are limited to informal discussions during breaks in between focused activities. Participants often choose a small number of people to network with individually or in groups based on similar interests or previous familiarity. This workshop provides conference participants a physical medium that supports collaborative knowledge building. Moreover, it creates a supporting environment for community building within Info+ by making values explicit as starting point of critical exploration.</p>

                                 <p>In recent years, meme studies have emerged as an interdisciplinary field that explores the cultural and communicative power of memes. Memes, often characterized by their humorous and viral nature, have become a ubiquitous form of online expression, shaping the way we engage with and understand contemporary issues. “Memes for Feminist Data Literacy” explores the immense potential of memes as a critical and transformative tool for data literacy. Acknowledging the uneven distribution of power, control and knowledge over data, data justice and feminist data futures should be seeked through critical and creative literacy methods, mediums, tools and tactics that unpack, communicate and challenge the existing imbalances rather than perpatuating the status quo and the matrix of domination. The primary goal of this workshop is to delve into the immense potential of meme-ification and memes as a critical and feminist data literacy medium, utilizing a co-design approach. By harnessing the visual and participatory nature of memes, we can challenge existing power structures and foster critical thinking in an accessible and engaging manner. By embracing the vernacular creativity of meme culture, we can spark conversations, raise awareness, and mobilize communities in pursuit of feminist data futures.<br>The primary goal of this workshop is to delve into the immense potential of meme-ification and memes as a critical and feminist data literacy medium, utilizing a co-design approach. It aims to approach data literacy through a feminist, critical and creative context rather than perpetuating the status quo and inequity and imbalances in data literacy. The workshop will provide a collaborative space for participants to reflect on the transformative power of meme-ification in raising awareness, mobilizing communities, and advocating for feminist data futures. We will explore how memes; an online medium that has been predominantly driven by and amplifying the voices of patriarchal norms and communities, can be harnessed to challenge the inequalities in access to data literacy, empower marginalized voices, introduce feminist perspectives to the data and amplify underrepresented perspectives.</p>

                                 <p>In Europe, every medicine package contains a leaflet. Every leaflet must mention the frequency and severity of side effects. At the moment, this is done through legally obligatory phrases like: ‘Very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people’, ‘Common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people’ and ‘Uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people.’ Most patients don’t understand these descriptions and overestimate the risks of taking a medicine. The goal of the workshop is to visualise the frequency and severity of side effects to inform patients in a balanced manner. The positive effects are that a medicine will be beneficial and it is unlikely that you get side effects. The negative effects are that there is a risk of side effects and some of these might be severe. The goal of the workshop is to find out if it is possible to visualise this balance in such a way that it enables patients to make a decision?<br>The outcome of the workshop will be a range of visuals for risk-benefit indicators that show both the frequency as well as the severity. All approaches can be explored: hand drawn sketches, digital files, AI-prompts, coding. The data from clinical studies for one medicine ‘ibuprofen’ will be used as a basis. Participants will learn the fundamental problem of informing patients about medical treatments. Clinical studies provide reliable data, but this data is rarely transformed into usable formats. Tackling a complex and difficult challenge in a short time is always enjoyable. The discussions will engage participants and bring them into contact with each other.

We will facilitate participants to explore ways of combating the often extensive material use that comes with making data physicalization practices and activities. Drawing on renewal and reuse principles from Sustainable Human-Computer Interaction, this workshop will introduce participants to one approach into sustainable data physicalization - the ZeroWaste PhysKit. While multiple approaches to creating more sustainable physicalizations can be envisioned (e.g. through addressing social or economic factors), this workshop will focus on the materials and resources needed to create physicalizations. Participants will be introduced to the concept of zero waste physicalization workshops and prototyping methods, and take part in a group-based activity to create their own data physicalizations using materials and methods that minimise or remove waste and resource usage. In addition to this, participants will be invited to reflect upon how they might incorporate a zero or low waste approach into their own practices, and how they might create their own kits to facilitate early-stage prototyping or educational activities. </p>

                                 <p>Finding or creating appropriate visualizations that meet the design goals can be a challenging task. In this workshop, we introduce a hands-on activity that guides through the process of understanding the essential building blocks of a visualization to crafting design variations. This workshop builds on the 'DNA of Visualization' framework that helps designers to generate visualizations options and to guide design choices. This framework uses the metaphorical concept of the “Visualization zoo” that was introduced by Jeffrey Heer et al., along with the idea of all visualization ‘species’ sharing a common ‘DNA’. By defining the fundamental building blocks of visualization, their interrelationships and their various combinatorial possibilities, the framework provides a method for deconstructing visualizations and a grammar that supports the exploration of the design space and guides the designer in finding appropriate visualization variations.
                                    <br>Building on a deconstruction and construction approach demonstrated, for instance, in the interface construction kit workshop, the workshop will include two phases to guide designers through the design process: (1) a deconstruction phase to help understanding a given ‘visualization species’ (chart type) by identifying its building blocks, such as the visual encoding techniques, the visual components and the types of information it encodes. (2) a construction phase that helps the designer to explore the design space to create different visualization variations. This design process is supported by a grammar that provides designers with guidance on how to combine VisDNA building blocks. 
                                    <br>The workshop is suited for practitioners and educators in the area of information visualization and design. It provides a grammar that can be used to understand the key aspects of a visualization and supports the exploration of the design space. The workshop material includes worksheets and a guided process to help designers to find an appropriate chart type for a given data set and to create and sketch other suitable design variations.

                    <p class="text">
                        At the Information+ exhibition we aim at showcasing recent contributions to the visual and
                        material
                        communication of information. We are looking for thought-provoking or radically designed pieces
                        that
                        derive from collaboration among disciplines, or from an interdisciplinary practice. We are
                        welcoming
                        individual or group submissions of data representation and visualization pieces in which the
                        main
                        intent is the communication of information. These pieces will be showcased during the
                        Information+
                        conference at <a href="https://inspace.ed.ac.uk">Inspace</a>, an exhibition space of the
                        Institute
                        of Design Informatics at the University
                        of Edinburgh.
                    </p>
                    <p>We welcome submissions in a multitude of mediums such as video (projected or displayed),
                        interactive
                        technology, physical and sculptural, drawings and illustrations, and digital prints.
                        Additionally,
                        we are also interested in showcasing the design process behind some of the featured pieces,
                        together
                        with all their dead-ends and accidental designs. If the work has been exhibited before, we will
                        ask
                        you to disclose this, and favor a new framing or interpretation linking the work to the
                        conference
                        and the exhibition.
                    </p>
                    <p>We are looking for a broad diversity of contributions, people, and topics, and we especially
                        encourage practitioners, designers, artists, academics, and others who are not usually
                        represented
                        at visualization and other data-oriented venues. A limited example of practices and applications
                        we
                        are looking for are:</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>The work will be selected by the Exhibition chairs in consultation with the conference’s
                        organizing
                        committee. All accepted work will be featured on this website, and in an online and printed
                        catalog.
                        Authors of the pieces will be asked to give a short artist talk introducing their work at the
                        opening of the exhibition. The authors will work with the conference organizers on details for
                        showcasing their pieces in the exhibition. Exhibiting artists will get complimentary
                        registrations
                        to the Information+ conference. No artist fees are provided. If accepted, we can subsidize
                        travel
                        costs in certain cases: please reach out to the Exhibition chairs if you don’t have a supporting

                        <p class="text">Information+ 2023 will take place in Edinburgh, Scotland. Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland, 
                        and the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament and the highest courts in Scotland. 
                        It is also a city of UNESCO World Heritage, and invites for walks through the medieval streets of Old Town 
                        and the Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill. Located at the southern 
                        shore of the Firth of Forth, the city is said to be built on seven hills, Blackford Hill, 
                        Arthur's Seat and the Castle Rock among them.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text">The city is and has long been a centre of education, particularly in medicine, Scottish law, literature, 
                        philosophy, the sciences, and engineering. In 2004 it was declared the first UNESCO City of Literature; 
                        for centuries Edinburgh has inspired writers from Sir Walter Scot, Robert Luis Stevensen, to Muriel Spark, 
                        Irvine Welsh and Ian Rankin, just to name a few.
